- [x] consistent variable usage in roles
- [x] STIG role in core is ugly, would this be better done as a tool
- [x] STIG reports separate form ncs_reporter?
- [x] Schemas bad idea?
- [x] Consistent generalized state export method
- [x] vmware plugins a bad idea? could they be partly made generic and then specific logic moved into tasks? seems like mental overhead to know what discover.py thing to use ect
- [x] need vmware variable complete audit (Moved to ncs_reporter)
- [x] split vmware stig into stig_audit and stig_remediate with no possible change of mutation using stig_audit (Logic decoupled)
- [ ] Implement remaining platform normalizers (Windows is basic, could be deeper)
- [ ] Integration test with real hardware outputs
