# internal.core.common

Shared helper role for reusable task snippets.

This role is primarily intended to be called with `tasks_from` from other roles
instead of executed directly as a standalone role.

Current shared task snippets include:
- `validate_typed_schema.yaml`
- `sync_ctx.yaml`
- `logging/info.yaml`
- `logging/error.yaml`
