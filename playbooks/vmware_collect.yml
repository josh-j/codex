# playbooks/vmware_collect.yml
# VMware infrastructure telemetry and metadata collection.
# This playbook focuses on high-speed data collection from vCenter and
# managed ESXi hosts. It gathers inventory details, hardware profiles,
# and cluster-level configuration metrics. The collected data serves as
# the primary input for both health dashboards and capacity planning
# reports within the centralized NCS reporting architecture.
