# roles/common/defaults/main.yaml
# STRUCTURAL DEFAULTS ONLY
#
# Purpose:
# - Provide an always-present ops.* skeleton so templates/tasks never explode on missing keys.
# - Keep ALL environment configuration in group_vars/all/00_global.yaml (ops_config).
#
# Notes:
# - These defaults must remain free of host/site-specific or time-specific values.
# - Runtime population happens in the playbook (or a single common init task).

ops:
  check:
    id: ""        # e.g. 2026-02-12_142806
    run_id: ""    # same as id (kept for compatibility)
    date: ""      # YYYY-MM-DD
    timestamp: "" # ISO-ish string (you decide format)
    site: ""      # inventory_hostname / logical site label

  overall:
    status: "Unknown"
    issues: 0
    summary: ""

  # Populated by binding ops_config -> ops.config at runtime
